- **CiefpMojTvEPG is an Enigma2 plugin that enables the display of an electronic program guide (EPG)**
- **for a large number of TV channels using data from the MojTV website.**
- **The plugin retrieves and displays information about the TV program, including broadcast time, show title and description, along with channel logos.**
- **Supports regional channels (RTS, HRT, Nova, Pink, etc.) and international channels such as HBO, Cinemax and Discovery.**

# Usage:

- **Installation: Install the plugin on your Enigma2 device and check if the python3-requests package is installed.**
- **Launch: Find the plugin in the plugins menu (Plugin Browser) and launch it.**

# Navigation:
- **Channel list: On the left side of the screen, select a channel using the up/down keys.**
- **EPG data: On the right side, the program for the selected channel (time, title, description) is displayed.**
- **Switch focus: Press "OK" to switch between the channel list and the EPG list.**
- **Exit: Press "Cancel" to exit the plugin.**
- **Logos: The plugin automatically retrieves channel logos and displays them at the bottom of the screen. If the logo is not available, a placeholder icon is used.**
- **Caching: EPG data is cached in /tmp/CiefpMojTvEPG for faster access (refreshed every hour).**

# Note:
- **An internet connection is required for proper operation. If an error occurs, check the log file in /tmp/ciefp_mojtv_epg.log.**
